 * @title ThriveCoin reward season contract
 *
 * @dev ThriveCoinRewardSeason is a simple smart contract that is used to store reward seasons and their respective
 * user rewards. It supports these key functionalities:
 * - Managing reward seasons where there is at most one active season, seasons can be added only by ADMIN_ROLE
 * - Adding user rewards to a season, only by WRITER_ROLE
 * - Reading user rewards publicly
 * - Sending user rewards to destination, done by reward owner or reward destinaion
 * - Sending unclaimed rewards to default destination, can be done only by admin
 *
 * NOTE: extends openzeppelin v4.6.0 contracts:
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.6.0/contracts/access/AccessControlEnumerable.sol
